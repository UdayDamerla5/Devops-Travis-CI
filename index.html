        <h1>CI/CD with Travis CI, Heroku, and GitHub</h1>
        <p>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery.</p>
        
        <h2>Process Overview</h2>
        <p>The CI/CD process involves the following steps:</p>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>1. Code Commit</h3>
            <p>Developers commit code changes to a GitHub repository. This is the first step in the CI/CD pipeline, where the latest code changes are pushed to the version control system.</p>
            <div class="graphic">
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Code+Commit" alt="Code Commit">
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>2. Build and Test</h3>
            <p>Travis CI automatically triggers a build and runs tests on the new code changes. This ensures that the code is functional and meets the project's quality standards before it is deployed.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>3. Deployment</h3>
            <p>If the tests pass, Travis CI deploys the application to Heroku. This step involves packaging the application and deploying it to a production environment where it can be accessed by users.</p>
            <div class="graphic">

        <h2>Visualizing the CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
        <div class="graphic">
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=CI%2FCD+Pipeline" alt="CI/CD Pipeline">
        </div>
        <p>The CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. It includes stages such as source control, build, test, and deployment. Each stage is designed to ensure that the code is ready for production and meets the project's quality standards.</p>
